Example 04: Combined standard uncertainty calculation for two cases:

Part 1: Orifice Meter
    - Performs analysis for an orifice meter using hardcoded input uncertainties and sensitivity coefficients.
    - Calculates combined standard uncertainty using the combined_standard_uncertainty function.
    - Compares the result against the conventional calculation from example 03.

Part 2: Ultrasonic Flowmeter (USM)
    - Performs analysis for an ultrasonic flowmeter (USM) with single P&T and GC.
    - Calculates combined standard uncertainty using hardcoded input uncertainties.
    - Compares the result against a reference case from the NGOFM GasMet uncertainty application.
